                    <h4>In Home</h4>
                    <p>
                        Speech therapy is available to you in the comfort of your own home.  I provide personalized, evidence-based strategies to meet your needs in meaningful and functional ways.  Training family and caregivers on ways to practice your goals outside of our sessions incorporates your whole therapeutic team.
                    </p>
                    <h4>In Community</h4>
                    <p>
                        Communication and cognition occur everywhere.  Many clients report challenges and increased stress in real-life environments outside of a typical clinic or office setting.  At your request, Neuro Inclusive Speech Therapy offers a unique opportunity for community-based services at the grocery store, your favorite coffee shop or wherever you choose!  Working on skills in the real world makes learning faster, easier and more engaging.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Telehealth</h4>
                    <p>
                        Flexible, high-quality telehealth options can meet your needs no matter where you live in Ohio.  Research shows that progress via a virtual platform is comparable to in-person services.  Patients report saving money and fewer missed appointments as potential benefits of virtual services. Neuro Inclusive Speech Therapy offers services through a secure, HIPAA compliant video option.

                                Neuro Inclusive Speech Therapy cares about you.  I am here to offer supportive, compassionate services to meet your identified needs.  Whether you are looking for only an evaluation, a white-section opinion or long-term therapy, we work as a team to decide the intensity and length of your treatment.  I respect and value your input and feedback during our sessions.  This collaboration adds to successful outcomes.  In addition to treatment sessions, I give home exercise programs so that you can progress towards your goals as quickly and efficiently as possible.

                                Dealing with long wait times and scheduling conflicts? Therapy for neurological and neurodegenerative conditions is best when started as soon as possible.  I am able to provide immediate appointments.  Later, I will gladly transfer your care if your spot opens up elsewhere.

                    <p>
                        Neuro Inclusive Speech Therapy offers private pay options.  An itemized invoice can be provided for you to submit to your insurance for potential reimbursement as most major insurances provide out-of-network benefits.  Speech therapy services are also eligible for HSAs (Health Savings Account) and FSAs (Flexible Spending Account).
