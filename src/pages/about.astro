                        Iâ€™m Nikki Loesch, a speech-language pathologist and the founder of Neuro Inclusive Speech Therapy. I spent almost ten years working and training at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago, ranked by U.S. News and World Report as the number one rehabilitation center in the United States for 35 consecutive years. During that time, I developed my expertise in rehabilitating both pediatric and adult patients.  I also have provided speech therapy services to adults and pediatrics in other hospital settings.  Please see my <a href="/pediatric-services">Pediatric Services</a> and <a href="/adult-services">Adult Services</a> pages for more information about the services I provide.
