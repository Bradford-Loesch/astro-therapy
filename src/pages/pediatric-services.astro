                        Targeted therapy strengthens thinking skills — including memory, attention, planning, organization, and problem-solving — for individuals experiencing brain changes or differences due to neurological conditions, illness or injury. Strengthening these areas promotes independence in everyday life and supports success at school or work through improved executive functioning skills.

                        Neuro Inclusive Speech Therapy offers comprehensive feeding services for individuals experiencing feeding and swallowing challenges related to neurological conditions. I specialize in treating sensory-behavioral feeding difficulties, with or without accompanying swallowing impairments (dysphagia), in children aged six months and older.

                    <p>
                        Feeding therapy supports children with many different eating challenges. If your child prefers only certain textures, tastes, or temperatures and has trouble trying new foods, feeding therapy may help. It can also benefit children who struggle with chewing, managing food in their mouth, or moving to age-appropriate foods and utensils.

                        I provide individualized, play-based language therapy to support all forms of communication. My approach incorporates parent coaching to encourage progress and confidence at home. I also offer comprehensive AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) evaluations and treatment to help each individual find their most effective way to connect and express themselves.
