                    <h4>In Home</h4>
                    <p>
                        Speech therapy is available to you in the comfort of your own home.  I provide personalized, evidence-based strategies to meet your needs in meaningful and functional ways.  Training family and caregivers on ways to practice your goals outside of our sessions incorporates your whole therapeutic team.
                    </p>
                    <h4>In Community</h4>
                    <p>
                        Communication and cognition occur everywhere.  Many clients report challenges and increased stress in real-life environments outside of a typical clinic or office setting.  At your request, Neuro Inclusive Speech Therapy offers a unique opportunity for community-based services at the grocery store, your favorite coffee shop or wherever you choose!  Working on skills in the real world makes learning faster, easier and more engaging.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Telehealth</h4>
                    <p>
                        Flexible, high-quality telehealth options can meet your needs no matter where you live in Ohio.  Research shows that progress via a virtual platform is comparable to in-person services.  Patients report saving money and fewer missed appointments as potential benefits of virtual services. Neuro Inclusive Speech Therapy offers services through a secure, HIPAA compliant video option.

                                My approach is centered on compassion, respect, and collaboration. Together, we'll identify your needs and use proven strategies to help you move toward your goals. Your voice and feedback are essential parts of our work — we'll grow and adapt the process as we go.

                            <p>
                                Whether you're seeking an evaluation only, a second opinion, or ongoing therapy, we'll work together to determine the most appropriate intensity and length of care. In addition to treatment sessions, I provide individualized home exercise programs designed to help you make steady, efficient progress toward your goals.

                                Struggling with long wait lists or scheduling issues? Therapy for neurological and neurodegenerative conditions works best when started right away. I can offer immediate appointments to get your care started, and I'll gladly coordinate a smooth transition once your preferred provider becomes available.

                    <p>
                        Neuro Inclusive Speech Therapy offers private pay options. Private pay allows me to prioritize your care with the highest level of service.  Most major insurances provide out-of network benefits.  An itemized services receipt (Superbill) can be provided to submit to your insurance for them to potentially reimburse you directly.  Speech therapy services are also eligible for HSAs (Health Savings Account) and FSAs (Flexible Spending Account).
